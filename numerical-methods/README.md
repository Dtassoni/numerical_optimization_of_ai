# Numerical Methods
This repository contains a collection of numerical methods implemented in Python. These methods are commonly used to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized into different directories based on the type of numerical method:

- `[root_finding](/root-finding/):` Contains methods for finding roots of equations.
- `[numerical_integration](/numerical-integration/):` Contains methods for numerical integration of functions.
- `[numerical_differentiation](/numerical-differentiation/):` Contains methods for numerical differentiation of functions.
- `[interpolation](/interpolation/):` Contains methods for interpolating data.

Each directory contains a README file with a description of the methods implemented in that directory.
