# Numerical Methods
This repository contains a collection of numerical methods implemented in Python. These methods are commonly used to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized into different directories based on the type of numerical method:

* [Root Finding](root-finding)
* [Interpolation](interpolation)
* [Integration](integration)
* [Differentiation](differentiation)

Each directory contains a README file with a description of the methods implemented in that directory.
